## Project Overview

A music artist commissioned me to create generative art that could be used as album artwork for their next release. I used the canvas-sketch CLI to create a single codebase that can produce a variety of artwork styles by varying parameters.

## Design Approach

The canvas-sketch CLI was used to create an animating image. The canvas-sketch-util library was used to achieve functionality such as the mapRange function and random noise.

The tweakpane library was used to create a UI that can be used to modify the parameters which govern the behaviour and design of the image produced.

A live site was created to allow the music artist to play with the settings and find the look they desired.
